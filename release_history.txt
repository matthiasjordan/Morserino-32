Work in Progress 2.3.0

* Echo trainer mode's speed adapt option will only change the speed after five
  consecutive successes or failures.
  

Release 2.2.0

* New game: Morse Tennis

* Straight key support as input method for all modes: users can use a straight 
  key and play Morse Tennis, use the Echo trainer or learn new Koch characters.
  
* Preferences overhaul: In top level, all preferences options are available.
  Inside of a mode only those options are available that are relevant to the
  current mode. E.g. Encoder Click is no longer in every mode but only in the
  top level options because once you selected it, you probably don't care any
  more. Same for other more general config options like CurtisB DitT% and so on.
  
* Fixed the scrolling issue that lead to the lowest rows of pixels of
  characters like "j" and "g" to be cut off.


Release 2.1.0

* Source code extensively refactored into smaller files for easier navigation
  and maintenance. In particular the menu subsystem was changed so new menu
  items can be added easier and without side effects.
  
* Removed "auto stop" feature and changed it into a new menu option 
  "Head Copying", which is way cooler.

* Removed some dead code.

* Now supporting SOS prosign.

* Generator mode does no longer print a white space at the beginning.
